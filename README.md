# SnakeProject
Done by Gil Arroteia and Jaime Silva. 
Project done for the course LAP(Linguagens e Ambientes de Programação). 
This project is done in js and html, we couldn't add more than this 3 files and couldn't change the narcissa0.js file
It consists in a snake game with a few twists:
-There's Shrubs which grow at a random time and which will kill the snake if it trys to eat them;
-There's 6 different berries that spawn;
-The snake has a stomach which is seethrough and has size 3;
-The snake cannot eat berries with the same color as of the ones inside her stomach, if it does it reduces her size to half;
-The berries have a random survival time and after that they start Falling for a short random time and the disappear;
-If the snake eats a falling berry it grows by 2 instead of one;
-The player can change the mode of the snake, the default mode the player controls the sanke, in the other mode the snake controls itself;
-The game saves the Best Score so far but when the player wins the game it starts saving only the Best time of the completed games;
